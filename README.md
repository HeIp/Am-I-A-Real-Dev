# Am I a Real Dev?
Find out by answering all important questions that matter to this quesiton: [AmIARealDev.com](http://AmIaRealDev.com/)

## Why?
Everytime someone say something like this:

>If you dont XXX, you are not a real dev

People get really mad.
It's not cool to throw rules like this and influence developers that don't know it is not necessarily true.

So I hope we can use [AmIARealDev.com](http://AmIaRealDev.com/) everytime this subject comes back again!
